You must install the following plugins. I haven't included them for licensing reasons but I have put configuration for them into the vault. If you click on each one in order and select *Install* then *Enable* before coming back here and selecting the next, the final one will kick up the Home page when ready.

- [CustomJS](obsidian://show-plugin?id=customjs): *Allows you to package up JavaScript into files callable in other places. I have used this to reduce code repetition and ease maintenance in my vault.*
- [Dataview](obsidian://show-plugin?id=dataview): *This one does most of the magic.*
- [QuickAdd](obsidian://show-plugin?id=quickadd): *This one I use to create macros like unchecking all checkboxes for me, quickly adding new tasks to inboxes, making new OKRs, and so on.*
- [Homepage](obsidian://show-plugin?id=homepage): *Makes the home page open at start-up*
