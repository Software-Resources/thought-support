The easiest way to work out how to use the cleaning schedule is to look at the supplied examples. These are actual jobs that I do, there are more jobs that need doing around here but fortunately I don't have to do all of them myself.

The today page of the cleaning routine is automatically generated using the following rules:

- A header "Morning" is displayed with all the tasks from the page [Daily Morning](Areas/Routines/Cleaning/Daily%20Morning) listed under it, along with all the tasks under the *Morning* heading in a file named after whichever day of the week it is in the folder set as *cleaning_root:* in a [Settings](Resources/Thought%20Support%20Help/Settings) file. By default this is *Areas/Routines/Cleaning*. Here are links to every day of the week: [Monday](Areas/Routines/Cleaning/Monday), [Tuesday](Areas/Routines/Cleaning/Tuesday), [Wednesday](Areas/Routines/Cleaning/Wednesday). [Thursday](Areas/Routines/Cleaning/Thursday), [Friday](Areas/Routines/Cleaning/Friday), [Saturday](Areas/Routines/Cleaning/Saturday), [Sunday](Areas/Routines/Cleaning/Sunday).
- A header "Less Frequent Tasks" is displayed which adds tasks from whichever page name matches the day of the week listed under the following headers:

	- First Week of the Month
	- Second Week of the Month
	- Third Week of the Month
	- Fourth Week of the Month
	- Fifth Week of the Month

	Tasks are added only if it is that week of the month, starting on a Monday within the month. The following headers also have tasks collected from them:

	- First Week of the Month (Quarterly)
	- Second Week of the Month (Quarterly)
	- Third Week of the Month (Quarterly)
	- Fourth Week of the Month (Quarterly)
	- Fifth Week of the Month (Quarterly)

	But only on the first month of a quarter (January, April, July and October).
- Finally there is a header "Evening" which works exactly like Morning does but for the evening.
