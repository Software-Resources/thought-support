There is a command pallete (*Ctrl+P*) option called *QuickAdd: Uncheck Checkboxes*. This is a very simple algorithm that resets the tick boxes on a page to unchecked. It only works on actual markdown, not dataview views and it really is simple so I recommend only using it on simple pages. In fact, I created it for me, there's better ways of doing that using other plugins so you should probably use one of those really, especially if your page is complicated in some way.
