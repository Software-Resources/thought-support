A QuickAdd macro has been added to the command palette in order to quickly save tasks to one of your Inboxes. You can find it in the command pallette (*Ctrl + P*) named *QuickAdd: Add to Inbox*. Task inboxes are defined by tagging them with \#Inbox by default (although you can change this tag in [[Resources/Vault/Settings]]). Tasks added using the QuickAdd macro are just added to the bottom of the file for now though if there is demand I may make do something smarter with it.
