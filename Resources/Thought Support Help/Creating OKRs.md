There are some dummy OKRs and KRs included to demonstrate how to make them. By default they live in the *Projects* directory at the root of the vault. Every OKR is expected to exist inside a folder where it's KRs are also found. You can do it by hand or use the QuickAdd macros by opening the command palette (*Ctrl +P*) and using *QuickAdd: Create OKR* command. Similarly to add KRs you can use the *QuickAdd: Create KR* command from the palette.
