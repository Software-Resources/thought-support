This feature could do with an editor as right now you need to edit all the front matter YAML by hand to manage the recipes. None the less, it is usable if you are careful.

I wrote it for myself to be able to quickly make smart choices based on the cost of food and it's calorie count. The calorie count and cost of food is automatically calculated from it's ingredients.

I will explain more about how to edit these files some time but for now you can see the folders *Ingredients* and *Recipes* located next to the Cookbook and Pantry for examples on how to create recipes and ingredients.

The *kcal* and *nutritional quanitity* values are used in preference from the product if it is present and from the ingredient as a fallback if it is not. This allows setting generic kcal values on products like chicken. If a product is in your pantry you have to set *kcal* and *nutritional quantity* values for it or the manager wouldn't know how to calculate the nutritional info.
