All of the settings for the vault are contained in settings files. A settings file is a file that is tagged with two tags:

- **\#Thought-Support**
- **\#Settings**

Any file with these two tags will be used to retrieve settings from and a setting will be returned from the first file it is found in. Settings are specified as fields in the YAML front matter dictionary. See the included [[Resources/Vault/Settings]] file if you need to change them. Some settings are private to the user and to enable sharing this vault I have separated those out. There is an example file with all the private settings included, [[Settings (Private Example)]].
