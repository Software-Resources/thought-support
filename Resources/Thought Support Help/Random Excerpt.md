This is featured on the home dash but also separately in the page [[Resources/Random Excerpt]] page if you prefer to inline link it or just want to take a look at a random excerpt on it's own! Excerpt files are located by placing them under the path set as *excerpts_root:* in a [Settings](Resources/Thought%20Support%20Help/Settings) file. Take a look at the [Enchiridion](Resources/Excerpts/Lifestyle/Stoicism/Epictetus/Enchiridion) file for an example on how to create one, it's siimply a list of excerpts as a markdown list and *author:* optionally added to the YAML front matter. Tags on the excerpts include all tags on the page containing the excerpts as well as tags on the list item itself.
