This is just an example file. These quotes are not my personal philosophy or anything. Don't rely on these as legitimate translations, I simply wanted to avoid copyright issues without pasting antiquated grammar from long dead authors. 

- Freedom lies in not trying to control what you cannot. (Chapter 19) #ExampleTag1
- It's not events that disturb us, it's how we view them. Let's not blame others but our views. Simple people blame others for their misfortune, smarter ones blame only themselves and clever people blame no one. (Chapter 5) #ExampleTag2
- Don't hope that events will turn out as you want, be glad to receive them as they are. This is peace. (Chapter 8)
- If you want to be the best version of yourself, be content to seem as naive instead of worldly. If anyone thinks you are important, you're making mistakes. It isn't easy to be both worldly and virtuous, investment in one taxes the other. (Chapter 13)
